# FUT Sniping BOT - FIFA 21 Autobuyer


## How it works

![](demo.gif)

Bot uses selenium framework to run fut web app. This is the best way to not get banned, because it is very similar to a normal user activity.

First step is logging in. You can do it manually or automatically.
If automatically - Bot have access to your email inbox, so it can read the newest ea message with an access code.
After running the web app, your filters are used to find a player (name and max price). 

The min price is increased before every search to have the results refreshed every time. 
By default bot clicks **+** button of min price 20 times, and starts again from 0.
You can change the number of increases using `INCREASE_COUNT` variable in the `config.py` file.

When the player is found, bot buys him, but sometimes it's too late. The result appears in the console:
- **Success**: *"Success! You bought player_name for X coins."*
- **Failed**: *"Found something, but it was too late."*

The bot stops working when you have no more money, or after 5 bought players (because you have to assign them, the feature is not done yet).

The current status is described in the console logs, so you have real-time access to information about the activities performed.

## Installation

```
make install
```

## Configuration

Everything is configured using `config.py` file.

Enter the name of the player name and the maximum number of coins you want to spend for him.
Example:

```
PLAYER = {
    "name": "Sterling",
    "cost": 100000,
}
```

### Automatic login

If you want to automatically login to web app, change this variable to False:

```
LOGIN_MANUALLY = False
```

Provide your credentials:

```
USER = {
    "email": "your_email@example.com",
    "password": "your_password",
}
```

You have to also provide your email credentials. It's needed to check the access code sent to your email address. 
**Remember to allow external tools in your mail configuration.**

```
EMAIL_CREDENTIALS = {
    "email": "your_email@example.com",
    "password": "your_password",
}
```

It's just first version of fut web app bot. The project will be further developed and new features will appear.
 
Good luck!
